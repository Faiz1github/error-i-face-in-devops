Learning Kubernetes
/////Make your networking concepts tight. 

3. Kubernetes documentation is clear, concise – grasp the essence. 

4. You don’t need to memorize – but get a hold of the key kubectl commands. 

5. Spin up a Kubernetes cluster – Minikube, k3s, or kind, doesn’t matter – just do it. 

6. Deploy something meaningful – nginx, a full-stack app, or an open-source project. 

7. Debug your own mistakes – pods in CrashLoopBackOff, networking issues, storage challenges – go through the grind. 

8. Build your own workflows – ingress routing, secrets management, autoscaling – play with real world scenarios.

I repeat – you learn by doing. Dot.
